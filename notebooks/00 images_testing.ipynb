      "The sky appears blue to our eyes because of a phenomenon called scattering. When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). These molecules scatter the light in all directions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, here's the important part: different wavelengths of light are scattered to varying degrees. Blue light has a shorter wavelength than red light, which means it is more easily scattered by the atmospheric molecules. This is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh who first described the phenomenon in the late 19th century.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result of this scattering, the blue light is distributed throughout the atmosphere and reaches our eyes from all directions, making the sky appear blue. The other colors of light, like red and orange, are not scattered as much and continue to travel in a more direct path to our eyes, which is why we see them coming from the direction of the sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's worth noting that this effect is more pronounced during the daytime when the sun is overhead, and the sky appears most blue. During sunrise and sunset, the light has to travel through more of the Earth's atmosphere to reach us, scattering off more molecules and making the sky appear more red or orange.\n",
